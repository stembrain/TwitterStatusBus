TwitterStatusBus
================

Captures your latest twitter status then sets it to display elsewhere. Michael Tyson's initial work helps set the twitter message as Adium and iChat status. Also the status can be injected as an RSS element so that OSX'  "RSS Visualizer" screen saver can display your status.
